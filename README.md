Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

Problem Statement

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats, where fraudulent websites mimic legitimate platforms to steal sensitive user information such as passwords, banking credentials, and personal data.

The goal of this project is to build multiple machine learning classification models that can automatically detect whether a website is phishing or legitimate based on URL and website features.
An interactive Streamlit web application is developed to demonstrate model performance and allow real-time testing using uploaded data.
